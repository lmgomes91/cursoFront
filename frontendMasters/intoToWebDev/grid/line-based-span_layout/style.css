/* Notes on this notation:
	grid-row: 1/ span 2;
vs
	grid-row: span 2;

In the first case, we are explicitly stating that this element should start at row line 1 and span two more rows.

In the second, we state that the element should span two rows from wherever it's placed.


Second -- here, we've pared back our layout directions to many fewer than in our first example. 

Grid will always try to lay out information from the upper left to the lower right (at least in left-to-right systems), with each grid item occupying one row and one column.

If you want to override that distribution, you must provide directions.
